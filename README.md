# Luca Pennini portfolio

Hi dear visitor, if you're visiting this page, is probably because you would like to verify my competences as a developer.  
In this folder you can find some little projects I decided to implement to show which are my skills, and also how they evolved during the time.  
I hope you will find them interesting, and if yes I'd be more than happy to hear from you at <luca198871@gmail.com>.

Below you can find a list with a quick description of the projects in this folder.

## Lightweight Router in ReactTS

In this project I'll make a lightweight basic router in ReactTS that we can use in small projects to trasform a SPA in a Multi Page looking Application.

### Main Components

lightweight_router\src\Router\Route.tsx  
lightweight_router\src\Router\Link.tsx  
lightweight_router\src\Contexts\RouterContext.tsx  
lightweight_router\src\Contexts\ContextProvider.tsx

### Functionalities

With this basic router you will be able to handle a client side routing within a single-page-application (SPA).  
It will be possible for you to navigate te routing history, and to eventually share a link to a preferred page.  
It also allows you to chose a different style or content based on the active state of the link.

## Personalized Components in ReactTS (wip - for now only Button)

In this project I'll make some basic reusable styled components that we may use in our React projects.  
The idea of this project is that big libraries like grommet, material, tailwind, bootstrap are for sure useful to learn and to use, and give the programmer a
ready to use high level product with advanced features; on the other side, they can make the project heavier, and for this reason for smaller projects we may
prefer to avoid these libraries in favor of some lightweight 100% customizable components.

### Main Components

#### Button:

personalized_components\src\components\Button\Button.tsx  
personalized_components\src\components\Button\Button.module.css  
personalized_components\src\utils\types.ts

## Websocket chat in ReactTS + node

While the previous projects were only front-end, this one will also involve a simple back-end made in node.js to manage the incoming messages.
